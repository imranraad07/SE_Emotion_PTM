I will add an `.eslintrc.json` file there too then :slightly_smiling_face: , I think a good solution would just be to extend the existing `.eslintrc.json` (meaning `""extends"": ""../../.eslintrc.json""`), as that is also what the existing `tsconfig.json` does (

However, I'm confused about how updates will work. I realize the syntax is nowhere close to final, but I'll use it as a reference for discussion.
In the example, if you used plain JavaScript expressions (`if`, `switch`, `for`, etc.) in your createView() call instead of `NgIf`, `NgSwitch`, `NgFor`, etc., wouldn't you have to destroy and recreate your view each time your context changed (expensive)? If you limited yourself to using the built-in structural directives instead then you could simply pass a new context to your embedded view, but I can imagine that devs familiar with React might assume that plain expressions would ""just work"" as they do in React, which might be a pain point.
If we do need to limit ourselves to using structural directives over plain expressions then it may be appropriate to provide some helper functions for the built-in stuff, so maybe instead of this:
[TRIPLE QUOTE]
You could do:
[TRIPLE QUOTE]
Of course, the community could build helper functions like that themselves. My main concern is that the way expressions restrict the ability to update a view may trip people up.

You are asking about the need to support dynamic TemplateRef generation - it's probably not absolutely essential, but I would really like it.

I agree that the latency really stymies the effectiveness and creativity of developers, especially when making ""small"" changes (this is a relative term based on your specific scenario obviously). HMR _can_ be a way around this but I have yet to see an implementation that works really well. I have always wanted Angular to embrace a more parallelizable compiler (although the compiler up till now has been fantastic), as large apps start to get a little iffy (other solutions to this obviously, such as incremental compilation from Nx, micro-frontends using module federation etc, but these are all more involved than optimizing the compiler, for the dev obviously, not for the angular term persay). I actually wrote a blog post on the bundle size/speed for our companies code base ([URL] as I have been interested in this for a while.
I like the idea of being able to allow for type checking to be more of a lint check but would either need to be well thought out since as [USER] mentioned type checking gets more important the larger the codebase or it would need to be opt in.
We use Nest and Nx at Trellis and the way `nx serve <nest app>` works is it will actually restart the server even if there are type errors and not hold up the refresh cycle. This can be handy, except when it's not, ie. you didn't notice you forgot to pass in a new function parameter and thats why your endpoint doesn't work, for example.
In my opinion **extreme** is the long term solution here, other tools are starting to integrate and support non TS based tooling (like esbuild and swc) as they are written in Rust or other more performant languages. I love Angular and don't want it to fall behind in terms of compilation performance or DX because it is not embracing new tools. Of course I realize this is a major lift and will take a lot of time and effort so I don't expect the Angular team to just go and implement it overnight but do strongly believe we need to keep up to date with tooling. The Angular CLI has always been one of the best selling points of Angular and one of the best built in CLI tools out there, let's not let it fall behind.

I think it is fine to always apply all regexes (or just apply the HTML regexes on TS files).

[BLOCK QUOTE].

As far as I can tell, this impression is not correct. Almost all* packages that are written in TS, transpiled to JS, and published to npm don't work with ""Go To Implementation"" any more than packages originally written in JS.

I said ""almost all"" above because there is a way to make it work: using the [declarationMap]([URL] tsconfig compiler option. But:

1. This setting is not enabled by default. IMHO it should be enabled by default whenever `sourceMap` is enabled. (Maybe also when `inlineSourceMap` is enabled?)
2. There is AFAICT no evangelism from the TS team (or anyone else!) about how package authors should enable this setting and include declaration map files when publishing their packages to npm.
3. There's also no push to get declaration map files into existing DefinitelyTyped packages. Could this be automated instead of relying on 1000s of type-package maintainers to do it?

Anyone who wants to see this problem get better could:

1. **Send a PR to try to change the default of `declarationMap` to be `true` if the `sourceMap` or `inlineSourceMap` option is `true`**. This minor change would probably have the biggest impact on this problem over time.

2. **Send a PR to update the TS docs to be more vehement that `declarationMap` should be enabled for all library packages**, and explaining why (""_because ""Go To Implementation"" in VS Code relies on declaration map files_""). These documentation changes will be crucial if (1) is not approved.

3. **Send a PR that adds or extends the TS docs with specific guidance for package authors**, including ""publish your sourcemaps"" and ""publish declaration maps"".

4. **Write a tool that will automatically add declaration map files to all compatible DefinitelyTyped packages**, and convince the DefinitelyTyped maintainers to merge the output of that tool into every compatible DefinitelyTyped package. Part of the work would be figuring out what ""compatible"" means and what packages' declaration maps can't be automated. Note that [USER] above was pessimistic that this automation would be possible. But I wonder if things have improved since then to make automation possible? Or if it'd be possible for a large subset of packages? Here's what he said:

[BLOCK QUOTE].


5. **Send a PR to change the build actions for DefinitelyTyped to warn users if they try to add a new package that lacks a declaration map**. Not sure if this is something that can be done outside the DT maintainer team, depending on how the existing DT toolchain works. Someone who knows DT better than me could answer this.

The community has agency! If we want things to get better, any of the items above can make things better.

There's also IMHO another confusion with ""Go to Definition"" vs. ""Go To Type Definition"" are implemented. My preference would be for ""Go to Type Definition"" to navigate to the types and ""Go to Definition"" to navigate to the implementation. Not sure this is worth changing community expectations, though, given how long the current behavior has been in place. For more details, see: [URL]",0,0,0,1,0,0

@sandersn and [USER] might have more tips about where/who to ask those kinds of question.
About `assumeTrue`'s meaning: to give you an example, I figured this one out by looking at the code in `narrowTypeByEquality` and seeing that `assumeTrue` had its boolean value flipped if the condition we had was an inequality (e.g. `a !== b`).
**tl;dr** in `narrowTypeByEquality(type, operator, value, assumeTrue)`, if `assumeTrue` is true we should assume `value` has type `type`. Otherwise, we should assume `value` does *not* have type `type`.

Unfortunately, that is not going to work in my setup: I am dynamically importing Preact during the runtime, that is `getPreact()` returns Preact's exports. `jsxImportSource` implies automatic import, which is not going to work. I can, of course, use it to silence TypeScript and continue using ESBuild, which will actually use `h` defined in the scope, but then TypeScript starts to complain about ‚Äòunused‚Äô `h` declaration, while also not saying anything if I don't declare the `h` (duh).
I'd actually expect TypeScript to *not expect* that `h` can only come from the imports, but rather do what ESBuild does ‚Äî use `h` defined within the scope; like in my situation ‚Äî it is defined at the top of the file. Thus I filed it as a bug report, because it's an absolutely valid use case.

For me the places where it was not used, like `@Input` or lifecycle hooks, feel out of tone from the rest of Angular.
* How do you plan to remove or replace Angular's dependency on RxJS without introducing a massive backward incompatibility breakup like in the AngularJS -> Angular 2+ era? Don't repeat history but learn from it!
* If you manage to not create backward incompatibility issues, then why do you think that introducing input as observable will?
* It _already_ is possible to merely see the usage of observable/observer as a Subscribable pattern. RxJS was meant to be functionality around this pattern. But because Observable was not an ECMA standard like Promise, Observable was included in RxJS. If I remember correctly, Ben Lesh regrets his decision not to make Observable a separate lib apart from RxJS, because now the two are seen as one while in fact they are not.

We already have angry mobs demanding that this happen for `import ""./foo""` ‚Üí `import ""./foo.js""` so if we allowed `.ts` extensions on there without it being very clear what use cases it is intended to serve, it would just pour fuel on that fire.
2. Such a flag would look like a gift to Deno users, but it would actually be woefully incomplete for them. There are obviously a lot of other parts of module resolution that are either specific to Deno or shared between Deno and the browser that we don‚Äôt currently support, and I think those users would be confused and disappointed that we stopped so far short of proper support for these things.

The only alternative would be treating properties that are known to be getters the same as function calls, which is not what you want in most cases, they are almost always supposed to be treated like regular properties.

Also, what does it mean for `snapToMin/Max` to be false? That the sheet slides without snapping between the outer snap points and the min/max? That sounds like very strange UX that we'd not want to expose...Or the sheet could always snap to the available snap points so you could drag to the max size, but if max size isn't a snap size, you'd snap back down to the nearest snap size. That sounds more sane, but still weird UX.

And this construction still doesn't ensure that users don't attempt to specify snap points that are outside of min and max-we'll still need an assert at least for that case.

What do you think about staying with just a plain old list and a bool (or just a plain list and no bool, with the added caveat that this means an empty list will enable snapping which is awkward...)? This keeps us in line with the one comparable example I know of (`LinearGradient.stops`) and it feels like we're adding a lot of complexity to avoid relying on assertion errors, I'm not sure I see the tradeoff being worth it.

I could move the assertion errors into the sheet's constructors so it's easier for devs to interpret the stacktrace-would that help? and/or we could return an ordered list instead of throwing if an unordered list is provided-but I think it's better to loudly fail than silently do something weird-I can't imagine a developer intentionally supplying an undordered list-it'll make their code way less readable.

Honestly, this is getting ridiculous. It's clear that you don't know what the heck you're talking about.
In the brief example you can't call `meth()` because TypeScript correctly narrows it to `never`. This is due to the behaviour of assignments narrowing the type of variables. TypeScript sees that a `Foo[]` is assigned, but no `Foo`. So trying to narrow it to `Foo` using `'bar' in ff` results in `never`, because it can't be a `Foo`.
If you take this behaviour out of the equation (e.g. by returning the value from a function) you will get the issue mentioned:

934976734,"[BLOCK QUOTE].
I'm not saying that a type cannot have additional properties (I said the exact opposite [here]([URL] myself). I'm saying the compiler is correct when handling `f` as `Foo` due to `Foo[]` ""not have"" `'bar'` because it already is the expected behaviour. The compiler is optimistic and handles as _exact types_ with respect to the `in` operator. This is enough for the vast majority of cases if you use good programming practices. I never had any problems using `in` to determine the type, neither in my personal projects nor in my work.

Maybe because it just happen that the browser doesn't wait for these operations, the use of the present tense would be more appropriate : _The HeroService must wait for the server to respond, getHeroes() cannot return immediately with hero data, and the browser does not block while the service waits._
If this proposition is not convincing, I think I will consider closing this PR: I would not want to overcomplicate the sentence because I alone mis-interpreted it.

I am currently spending 80% of my time on this. I cannot promise any specific dates, but the roadmap ***tentatively*** looks like this:

- September: finish implementation on the prototype. We will probably add a `FormTuple` class, but it's otherwise very close to complete. If you're curious, the in-progress commit is linked to this issue.
- October: check that google3 internal migration is seamless (simply adding explicit `<any>` type params at call sites should preserve the exact old behavior). If there are any big compatibility issues, we'll find them here.
- November: publish an RFC, with emphasis on important design questions (i.e. whether to capture `AbstractControl` types in the type parameters, the tradeoffs of `FormArray<string[]>` vs `FormArray<string>`, etc).
- November: publish a downloadable version of the package that people can swap in to try out, and collect info on whether it causes any breakages.
- May: ship it with v14, together with a migration schematic. I'm aware that this has slipped from v13 -- unfortunately, there's just not time for the RFC or google3 migration before v13.

Again, I can't promise these dates, but I think the schedule is reasonable. The biggest risk is that the google3 migration uncovers a show-stopping backwards incompatibility.",0,0,1,0,0,0

I'd wager that those who rely on it would like to know that it has been ""significantly de-prioritized"" quietly. Why not loudly request community or corporate support?
We know where the bugs, flaws, and deficits are. Not sounding the alarm about them outside of issue trackers and using an ""ALL ENGINES GO!"" tone in the documentation/communications is unhelpful and infuriating for the people who have to dig around in the code to see what's really going on.
I love Angular. However, the communication issues (policies?) combined with actual bugs make me understand why there's no amount of money most JS, React, and Vue developers can be paid to learn Angular.
It's a shame! Angular+NgRx are the best way to structure code for the web. I've described using Angular as running with rocks in my shoes. Very nice shoes that help you run very fast to be sure, but, the rocks eventually leave your toes bloody.
Angular has a lot of issues. More than most open source projects. While features like optional modules have been getting a lot of attention, modules are not one of the issues keeping developers from adopting or learning Angular. Poor communication, bugs, and moving slowly on common functionality/features large and small (Zone.js+async/await, no passive HostListeners w\o hacks, etc.) *are* keeping developers out.
It's also hard to get a deep insight into what's actually going on with Angular development. That information is scattered across GitHub, Twitter, Medium, a smattering of newsletters, courses, and videos, or, is internal to Google and not communicated to external developers at all.
The Angular blog hasn't been updated since early June and the Twitter account is often surface level DR/PR. Reading the Twitter account, the most robust Angular news aggregator, you'd have no idea that a major Angular package like animations is unmaintained. How do you stay truly informed?
From the outside it seems like the day-to-day problems/bugs are here to stay.
I've never seen a large open source project run like Angular. It's not working.
Here's a positive example: This is how I keep up to date with Django development:
Typically there are a few posts similar to this([URL]) on the [homepage](https://www.djangoproject.com/) that contains a link to extensive, developer friendly, release notes([URL]) for each release.
To compare, Angular's homepage does not feature the latest releases (LTR, latest, or dev/next) and Angular's [release notes]([URL]) are less useful. New features link to, sometimes, several GitHub issues and release notes are not linked anywhere on the Angular homepage. I think this is by design? Hiding the version numbers to keep from scaring off new developers?

- [URL]
- [URL]

My intention of this issue thread is not seeking for help or asking a question, but reporting a bug/regression in Webpack 5 as it has deprecated the `{file,raw,url}-loader`s in favor of native asset modules and currently it's not possible to load assets from within a loader (while loading them from regular imports works - of course).

Also, special syntax should not be needed for this, because otherwise it's a breaking change, and this is not documented. And if this is indeed needed, then how is a loader supposed to know when a certain request is an asset and when not? This is not the job of the loader but the module rules configuration and webpack resolving it correctly.

----

I haven't found any documentation in regards to this request syntax and thus took a look at the code and found the responsible parts in the `resolve` hook of the `NormalModuleFactory`.

While setting breakpoints and debugging through this code, it looks like a simple type override, but unfortunately it doesn't do anything in this case.

It is an annoying problem, especially you are working with other non alphabetic languages. It is a big problem if your text has to be aligned with other elements. It is aesthetically not acceptable.

You can fix it by setting a fixed height in TextStyle as a walkaround, but there is no universal value that you can use to fix the problem for a particular language at all places in your app. You have to try and error to find an acceptable value. Imagine your app is reasonably big and supports multiple languages.

@DanielRosenwasser Sorry for bothering, but I want to ask some questions before continuing coding. Or is there an existing design meeting note I missed?
Some existing problem I found(or I think it is! Not pretty sure):
1. Property could not inherit JsDoc too, not only setter/getter
2. When we have setter and getter in base class and derived class, and the getter and setter in base class are documented, the description of quickInfo getter/setter in derived class are both combined. I think they should only inherit correspond accessor.
3. quickInfo of getter and setter in class declaration should be ""getter""/""setter"" rather than ""property""

The division between js/ts and html is a bit flawed, as we can have the html in the component's decorator :cry:
(js/ts can't really be present in html to the extent of having eslint comments there I believe)

so I may need to rethink that... or just apply the all regexes to all types js/ts/html (I don't see too much a problem with that, except having html comments with js/ts code with eslint comments and vice versa)....

( this could actually force me to restart from scratch :disappointed: )

I am so sorry for realizing this only now... :cry:

What are your thoughts on it?

___

or I could just ignore the html comments that could contain js/ts and handle ts in the following way:
 check if there is a `@Component` decorators and see if it uses the `template` property, if so put a placeholder for the html, run the normal js/ts lint on the file with the html placeholder and reapply the original html but run through the remove eslint-comment function (sort of borrowing the same logic I mentioned here([URL]))",0,0,0,0,1,0

- Always return all errors, then have `tsc` have a filter when displaying errors for JS files. This would add errors to all other API consumers, though.
- Give the language service a separate way to request unchecked JS errors. The checker will have to store these errors separately and the language service will have to add them late.
- Possibly: Not report these errors in the ""errors in closed files"" list. But I don't know if that would be what users of that feature expect.

Opinions? Ideas?

I'm pretty sure that this feature is going to stick around and grow, so I'd like for it to be easier to use than to not use.
